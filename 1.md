## Java Basic Concept

### Start From HelloWorld

```java
public class Demo{
	static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Hello, world!");
	}
}
```
Questions:
1. What's the name of this java file?
2. How to use java and javac in command line?
3. What should you do if you want to output "Hi, world!"?

### Variable, Method, Statement and Comment

```java
public class Demo{
	static void main(String[] args){
		int a = 1; // assign 1 to variable a
		System.out.println(a);
	}
}
```

Questions:
1. What does **void**, **int**, **double** stand for?
2. Why a is a variable, System.out.println() is a method?
3. How can you tell if one single line is a statement or not?
4. How should you name a class, a variable and a method?
5. What's the difference between int and Integer? How to tell if a variable type is reference or primitive?
6. When shoule we use comment?

### Define a Method

```java
public class Demo{
	static Integer sumTwo(int a, int b){
		return a+b;
	}

	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println(sumTwo(1,2));
	}
}
```

Questions:
1. What does the key word **return** stand for?
2. Why we put **Integer** before sumTwo, **void** before main?
3. Can we difine a method in the body of another method?
4. Do we need to input the exact value of input variable when defining the method?

### Array

Questions:

1. How to create a static array?
2. What does **String[] args** stand for in main method?
3. Please write a java file, every time we put two integers in argument, the sum will be printed out.

### Boolean and Condition Control

```java
public class Demo{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		for (int i = 1; i < 10; i=i+1){
			System.out.println(i);
		}
	}
}
```

Questions:
1. What's the difference between **=** and **==**?
2. Must **else** occur in pair with **if**?
3. What it would be if **for (int i = 1; true; i=i+1)**? What if **for (int i = 1; false; i=i+1)**
4. How to use key word **for**?
5. What does **!**, **<=** and **!=** stand for?

### Try and Catch

```java
public class Demo{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		try {
			int[] myNumbers = {1,2,3};
			System.out.println(myNumbers[10]);
		} catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println("Something went wrong.");
		} finally {
			System.out.println("The 'try catch' is finished.");
		}
	}
}
```

Questions:
1. Must **catch** occur in pair with **try**?
2. What does the key word **finally** stand for?
