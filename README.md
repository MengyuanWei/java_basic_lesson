### Add-Ons:
### Variable Type: Reference Versus Primitive

There are two types of variables in Java, primitive and reference type. All the basic types e.g. int, boolean, char, short, float, long and double are known as primitive types. JVM treats them differently than reference types, which is used to point objects e.g. String, Thread, File and others. **Reference variables are not pointers but a handle to the object which is created in heap memory.** The main difference between primitive and reference type is that **primitive type always has a value, it can never be null but reference type can be null**, which denotes the absence of value. So if you create a primitive variable of type int and forget to initialize it then it's value would be 0, the default value of integral type in Java, but a reference variable by default has a null value, which means no reference is assigned to it.

### Object Oriented Programming (OOPs) Concept in Java

As the name suggests, Object-Oriented Programming or OOPs refers to languages that uses objects in programming. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, hiding, polymorphism etc in programming. **The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.**

### Homework
1. How many integers that can be divided by 7 or contain 7 (e.g. 17, 27)from 1 to 1000? Write a class with main method to slove this proble.
2. Write a *Fibonacci.java*, everytime you compile it and excute with an integer in arguments, the first n number in Fibonacci.sequence will be returned.
